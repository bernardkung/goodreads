# Considerations at this point:
# Clean up the ISBN and ISBN13 columns. Import misread some formatting(?) data as characters and I want to isolate the numbers
# Prune columns that are empty and not interesting to me (e.g. Condition, Spoiler, etc)
# Augment data with columns that would be interesting (e.g. Genre)

### Excising empty/uninteresting columns
gr <- select(gr, 1:10, 12:16, 19)

### Cleaning up column names
names(gr) <- gsub(x = names(gr), pattern = " ", replacement = "")

### Binning date read by year
gr$YearRead <- substr(gr$DateRead, 1,4)


### Cleaning ISBNs
# type1: ="0802142990"
# type2: =""

# Checking ISBN lengths for consistency
# unique(sapply(gr$ISBN, nchar))
# unique(sapply(gr$ISBN13, nchar))

# Re-writes with extracted digits or NAs out of ISBN and ISBN13
gr$ISBN <- str_extract(gr$ISBN, "[[:digit:]]+")
gr$ISBN13 <- str_extract(gr$ISBN13, "[[:digit:]]+")

### Filter out to-read books

# Let's shorten the title lengths
